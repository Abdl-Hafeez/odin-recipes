    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Shortbread cookies are extremely easy to make with a hand or stand mixer. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief breakdown of what you can expect when making these cookies:
    </p>
    <p>
        Cream the butter and sugar together. Then, add the vanilla and flour. Mix until combined. Use a cookie press or roll out the dough and cut or shape into desired shapes. Bake until cookies are golden brown.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat softened butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in vanilla; add flour and mix well until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill cookie press with dough and form cookies onto two ungreased cookie sheets, spacing them about 1 ½ inches apart. Bake until the edges of the cookies are just starting to turn golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the cookie sheets from the oven, and set them on a wire cooling rack for a few minutes. Then transfer the shortbread cookies to the rack to cool completely.
        </li>

    </ol>
